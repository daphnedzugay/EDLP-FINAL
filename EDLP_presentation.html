<h3 id="experience"> My Experience as a Peer Leader </h3>
<p> I knew when coming into the position that I wanted to be like a 'big sister' who was there when students needed. It's fulfilling to feel like I truly can make a difference in a first-year student's life. When I stepped into our first class, I think that many of the students thought I was one of their peers, but once I waltzed up to the front, they knew that I was going to be someone teaching them. Once I pulled up my first check-in question, they were hesitant to speak to me or answer the question in front of their peers, but as the semester went on, they started looking forward to my check-ins and seeing what crazy question I had for them to answer that day. One thing about me before becoming a peer leader was that I LOVE to make presentations fun to keep an audience engaged, and I was able to do exactly that. It was exciting and made me feel good that one of my main responsibilities for my class was the <span onmouseover="this.style.color='orange'; this.style.fontSize='15pt'" onmouseout="this.style.color='black'; this.style.fontSize='12pt'"> check-in questions </span> and they loved this the most! My check-ins definitely tried to be on track to smoothly transition into the topic for the day, but sometimes I wanted to know answers that revolve around a student's personality and spark up conversation between the students.</p>
<ul>Some of my check-in questions include:
<li>"If you could get a tattoo today, what would it be and why?" </li>
<li> "What's your favorite cereal?" </li>
<li> "Which Mario Kart character is your go-to or favorite?" </li>
<li> "Who or what is the sunshine on your rainy day?" </li>
<li> "If you were a flower, what kind of flower would you want to be and where would you want to grow?" </li>
</ul>

</div>
<p> Lastly, my peer leader experience revolved greatly around teaching with my co-instructor. I don't think I would've been able to make it through the semester without my co-instructor, <span onmouseover="this.style.color='orange'; this.style.fontSize='15pt'" onmouseout="this.style.color='black'; this.style.fontSize='12pt'"> Michelle </span>. She truly took the weight off of my shoulders when I wasn't as comfortable teaching a specific lesson or didn't know how to respond to a certain question. She made it easy to get comfortable talking in front of the class and taught me how to project my voice and slow down at certain points. This was one of the things I wanted to work on the most! Throughout the semester, I slowly began getting better at speaking more confidently, not that I didn't like speaking before, but it was easier to get a point across quicker and in a fun way without losing the audience. Being a peer leader truly brought different responsibilities to my life, including reading the room to know what next steps are or checking up on different students who may have been quieter than usual that day. </p>
</div>

<div>
<h3 id="success"> My Successes </h3>
<p> My successes definitely include the check-ins that I spoke about previously, but I think small successes like feeling more comfortable in front of a room or being able to teach a lesson on my own are important. Within the first few weeks of the class beginning, I had to give the Alcohol EDU presentation. I knew going into the class that I wanted to make a fun and engaging presentation, even though it was filled with a lot of important and heavy information. Although it was hard in the beginning, my students understood the topic and had lots of questions to ask, many questions that I don't think would've been brought up if my co-instructor was in the room. To me, this was one of the most important lessons to receive as a freshman in college, especially since it's a very new environment to most students and rules are still upheld after moving out of your parents house. Since this class went so well and students were open, I count my teaching experience of the topic a success!</p>
<p> Other successes as a peer leader include being a big resource for students and creating connections between each student. These were probably one of the most important successes I wanted to have. Being a resource seemed difficult in the beginning, but after doing research every week, receiving our peer leader newsletter on Friday mornings, and knowing about clubs and teams from my own experience, it was a breeze! My students know that they are able to reach out to me at any time with any questions or comments they may have regarding the university, personal matters, or roommate matters. This goes into the idea of creating connections between each student. Along with this, <span onmouseover="this.style.color='orange'; this.style.fontSize='15pt'" onmouseout="this.style.color='black'; this.style.fontSize='12pt'"> 1:1s helped A LOT! </span> For 1:1s, my co-instructor and I gave students the option to meet with either one of us or both of us, if they wanted. Because of this, it was a huge success on my part because most of the class wanted to meet with me to chat. It made me feel so good about myself knowing I made enough of impact at that point in the semester for them to want to speak to me! Most of my students are extroverts and fill in any awkward silence there may be in the classroom. These are the students that definitely reach out the most to know about events and things that are happening on campus to find their clique. On the other hand, Michelle and I had a few introverts that didn't really talk much during class time, but would reach out to us afterwards to chat. These students were the most challenging to connect with because they didn't open up much in the beginning of the semester. However, now, they love to see me on campus, walk to class with me, or even want me to meet the friend groups they have found! </p>
</div>

<div>
<h3 id="challenge"> My Challenges </h3>
<p> As many successes that a peer leader may have, there were some challenges. Some days, students were just not up for a class or a lecture and as a student myself, I understand this greatly! On other days, some students had a lot of homework or big exams the next day and this made it difficult to keep them engaged in the lesson when they were thinking about other classes. This goes a lot into the idea of classroom management where sometimes, students just did not want to talk or listen to what Michelle and I wanted to get across. Although University 101 is a 'fun' class, there are lessons that are important to be taught and learned and will be used for the remainder of their time here at the University of South Carolina. 
<p> Another challenge that came up throughout the semester was overall burnout. I think, as a student, it's hard to create an environment that college is the most amazing place in the world when you, yourself, are unable to keep afloat in your own courses. Because of this, I had major burnout in the middle of the semester because of my course loads, studying and homework taking all of my weekday and weekend time, and trying to stay on top of my assignments while trying to create an open and free environment for my students. As much as I wanted to be this very open resource and a 'you can talk to me anytime' peer leader, this was unattainable at a certain part of the semester when I was in the same boat as my students. By the same boat, I mean having two exams on a Tuesday, another two on Wednesday, and then a research paper due on Thursday. With this idea in mind, I did end up needing to drop a course before the drop/add deadline and I think that this was the best solution to my burnout issue. As much as I felt 'behind' in my degree, it helped me mentally and physically to be on track for other courses and also for my University 101 class. By experiencing this and the need to drop a course, I think it set some type of alert off in the minds of my students because they saw that it is okay to need to drop a course or take a mental health day instead of work, work, work. Once I was open about this experience halfway through the semester, my students seemed to have had a deeper connection with me because some of them were going through the same burnout. </p>
</div>

<div>
<h3 id="learn"> My Learning Experience </h3>
<p> When it comes to learning experience, I think the number one thing that I needed to learn was that every student and University 101 class is different. I know when I listen to stories from my peers in EDLP I think that their students are more open or aren't as open as mine, but I always think back to our Fall Training when we spoke about peer leader envy. With this always in mind, I knew that there was no need to compare classes because every class is different and filled with different students. On the track of different students, I already touched on how some of my students were extroverts and some of them were introverts. With this, I needed to learn that some students grasp concepts differently or some students learn more through videos and pictures rather than words on a powerpoint. This led to many ideas of keeping each student engaged through having a mixture of presentation that are eye-catching to both parties. For example, Michelle and I always thought of ways to incorporate pictures, gifs, Youtube videos, or games to keep the students who learn the best this way engaged. On the other hand, we also had classes with presentations that had more words and spoke about it more to keep the other half of the class engaged. This was one of the biggest learning experiences for being a peer leader: trying my best to incorporate the information in ways that all of the students in my class are able to understand and grasp. </p>

</div>
<p>Another learning experience that came up through being a peer leader was working with a co-instructor. As mentioned previously, I could not have gone through this course without Michelle. Because we bounce off of each other so well, there was never a time that I felt like I was stepping on toes. However, this was a learning experience to understand. The idea that my thoughts may not mesh well with Michelle's or my input may not be good for the topic was scary, but I learned that to be a good leader, we both need to be on the same page. Along with this, being a role model in general was a huge learning curve. In a way, I needed to be 'above' the students, but at the same time needed to be at their level. Learning to balance both was challenging at first, but I'm glad I was able to come to a good point to be both. This mindset can help a lot in the future if I were to be in a managerial position working with staff below my position or the opposite where I may need to lower my mindset when speaking toward a supervisor. In the end, having a good idea on what a good leader is, how they act, and what they think all revolve around our peers, students, and other staff members. With this, it may be a learning experience in the future, again, to find a new balance!</p> 
</div>

<div>
<h3 id="goals"> My goals from the beginning of the semester, till now </h3>
<p> In the beginning of the semester, I was super nervous about being a peer leader with asking questions like "Will I do well?" Or "Will they like me?" If you ask me now about my goals, I feel like I can safely say that I have accomplished them! Once the first day passed, I knew that this program is exactly what I wanted to be doing. Since my University 101 experience, I have raved about it and I hope that my students feel the same way, which I think many of them do! In regard to my successes, I had the goal of being a good and open resource to my students. With this in mind, I feel like I did well in this aspect of the peer leader position. Whether that was done through sending out a weekly GroupMe message about the upcoming events for the week, reminders about being safe of football games, or just being open to chatting if needed, I am a good resource. </p>
<p> The second main goal I had for the semester was to be approachable. I remember when it was Spring Training and we went over ways to be approachable to students. We spoke about letting the students know you are there for them and wanting them to succeed. Through this part of the training, I made it known to my class that I want them to succeed and that I am proud of whatever they may accomplish throughout the semester. After the first time I told them I was proud and honored to be their peer leader, this suddenly opened a door to students wanting to reach out to me to chat about roommate issues, hard classes, and events/clubs they wither went to or were thinking of joining. One thing that truly opened up the connection between the students and I were 1:1 conversations. Many students who I didn't quite expect to want to chat with me only, wanted to! Many of the introverts in my class wanted to speak with me and opened up greatly during our conversation. There was never a 1:1 that lasted less than 15 minutes! Because of this detail, I think I made it known to them that they can approach me with any type of questions or rants they may have throughout the semester. Along with this, they also know that if they see me on campus or at game day, that they can always say hello, walk with me on campus, or even meet the friends I may be with! It's safe to say that when we did meet for a 1:1, the flood gates were open on their end and my ears were open to listening to anything they needed to put out. To end this note, I feel accomplished with the relationship and connections I have made with each and every one of my students. At the beginning, it seemed hard to try to make every single student happy, but throughout the semester, it became a lot easier and ended up being fully accomplished! </p>

<div>
<h3 id="future"> How can I use this experience for the future? </h3>
<p> As a peer leader over the semester, there were many skills that I either didn't think I needed, or never would have been able to gain. When speaking to a group, you need to be clear, have a good tone, and read the room. These skills will come of great use in the future for my career and other job opportunities that may arise in the near future.</p>
<ul> These skills include:
<li> Time management </li>
<li> Patience </li>
<li> Understanding </li>
<li> Leadership </li>
<li> Adaptability to various situations </li>
<li> Good communication </li>
</ul>
<p> Through learning skills like time management and adaptability, these can be used in future job opportunities and my career. To be able to handle both being a student and a peer leader, it creates a balance between my own work and working with others. This skill can be used in any workplace setting when needing to work with other staff members, speak with a supervisor, or overall balancing work life and social life. Time management is also a huge skill to have when working anywhere. Whether that is the New Student Orientation Office, a law firm, a manager at a birthday party industry, or more, time management and good communication are needed to be able to keep the workplace in tact--just like a classroom. This goes into patience and understanding. Both of these qualities are needed to be able to keep a classroom running smoothly, same as if it were a board room meeting. Many people lose patience when listening to other people speak or get their point across, but by gaining the skill of having patience, you are able to be open to what other people are saying, situations people may be going through, or even waiting for a response to an email from a supervisor. <span onmouseover="this.style.color='orange'; this.style.fontSize='15pt'" onmouseout="this.style.color='black'; this.style.fontSize='12pt'"> Patience is the KEY to understanding </span> ! </p>
